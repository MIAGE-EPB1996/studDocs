### Welcome to the StudDocs Roadmap

StuDocs is a project to enhance the learning experience for the MIAGE program at the university Panthéone-Sorbonne Paris 1.

Thanks for beeing part of it!

## Motivation

After some inqueries it was clear that the MIAGE program does not have a location where students can find course materials that have been created, curated or corrected by other students.

This was used extensively in the other universities I have studied and I thought why not start doing something similar for the MIAGE program here in Paris.

This project is designed to be a project from students for students. The idea is to create a place where different study material can be gathered and easily accessed by students of any level.

These materials can include:

- Exercises and their solutions
- Projects templates
- Tools
- Way of working
- Personal experiences and ideas
- Interesting and cool stuff

## Features

There are **3 main parts** of this site:

### Courses

Should be the place where all course specific materials should be gathered.

    - partitioned into the different study levels (**L1**, **L2**, **L3**, **M1**, **M2**)
    - subsections for all the different courses of each study level (ex. **INF4 for M1**)

### Tech Blog

People moslty associated with Tech can share interesting new technologies and tools used by them privately or professionally by their enterprises

    - Depending on the level and interests of people
    - Allows students to learn from the expertice of others and participate

### Management Blog

Experiences, tools and tips or discussions from the more management oriented side of our studies.

    - Showcasing success stories
    - Learning and finding ideas

## Docusaurus for the win!

This project is using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) from Facebook.

Its the perfect tool to create this kind if site, since it is a open source tool used in tech industry to create documentations of different kinds.

It will introduce students into several concepts of developing where each student can take part in and learn as he is providing information for the next year of students.

Creating new content will be done via **GIT Pull Requests**. This introduces starting developers to this kind of working and provides a safe environment to make mistakes and learn from more experienced students.

Writing your thesis is already challenging. Don't make it harder by using Word or any other text editor. It's a hassle to get all the formatting right, add literature reviews, tables, and more.

Do yourself a favor and use **[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)**, the typesetting system used by scientists worldwide. Also, check out **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)**, a free online editor for your LaTeX projects.

## The Way of the Scientist

Writing your thesis is one of the first steps into the world of scientific writing. As such, you should use proven tools to write your work. Word or similar software is not suited for scientific writing; ask your professors, and they should agree... at least I hope so.

In this post, I want to introduce you to a specific LaTeX template and working environment I used to write my M1 thesis. I had a blast since I spent virtually no time on formatting or double-checking page numbers. The best part was the easy integration and referencing of the papers I used.

Give it a try! You'll love it!

### What is LaTeX?

For a detailed introduction, check out the [official LaTeX site](https://www.latex-project.org/about/).

In short, LaTeX allows you to focus on writing rather than formatting. The document format can be defined much like in software through variables and functions, ensuring consistent rendering.

By using templates, we can reuse formats and styles, adding only the written content and letting LaTeX handle the rest. I recommend a template from a generous individual who published it for free use. The features include:

- Automatic handling of references and links, compiling them into a reference list at the end of the document.
- Easy and automatic labeling and referencing of tables and photos.
- Automatic acronym creation (e.g., Machine Learning (ML)) and inclusion in a word dictionary/explanation.
- Many more features.

### How to Work with LaTeX

You can work with LaTeX locally in a specific editor or even in VSCode. However, to make it easier, I suggest using **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)**, an online LaTeX editor. It directly renders the content you add, which is fantastic!

You only need a free account to get started.

Here is the template I mentioned above already prepared to be used in Overleaf: **[Polytechnic University of Leiria Thesis Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/unofficial-polytechnic-university-of-leiria-estg-thesis-slash-report-template/tqgbrncfhwgt)**

You'll need to customize some parts and get used to working with LaTeX, but believe me, you'll be better off in the long run.

### How does it look like?

To give you a quick preview of what your final document might look like, here's my thesis written with the template:

**[2024_M1MIAGE_BAUMGARTNER_Evaluation Methods for Generated Code](2024_M1MIAGE_BAUMGARTNER_Evaluation_methods_for_generated_code.pdf)**

This should give you an idea of the clean and professional formatting you can achieve with LaTeX and Overleaf without you doing anything for it:)

## Well... Copilot here here I come

Copilot is a ChatGPT4 based coding tool that does a lot of things for you:

- Code completion
- Code generation
- Code explanation
- Data generation

Let's be honest... you will abuse the shit out of this tool but beware:

:::danger

1. **YOUR BRAIN IS GOING TO SHRINK IF YOU DONT USE IT.**
2. **DO NOT BLINEDLY USE AND EXECUTE CODE WRITTEN BY A MACHINE. (YES, THERE ARE SECURITY RISKS)**
3. **YOUR PROFESSORS KNOW YOUR CODING LEVEL...** - so yes they know you are using it for your excercises
   :::

In general, do yourself a favor and also use your brain to solve problems.

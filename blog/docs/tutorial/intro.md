Or you can use the following email address: baume96@gmail.com

## Project

Get started by **cloning the repository**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIAGE-EPB1996/studDocs.git
```

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

### Get the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the project locally

Run the development server:

```bash
cd blog
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

## Editing stuff

Under `docs/courses` you will find all the markdowns that represent the different courses.  
Under `blog/` all the current blogs are displayed. 

Open one of the markdowns and make your changes. The site at http://localhost:3000/ **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
